			<p id="with-element">Syracuse city schools are ranked the 13th most segregated in the nation according to a study conducted by the Century Foundation. The I-81 highway in Syracuse has served as a physical barrier between high-income white families and low-income families of color since its construction in 1959. This separation has extended into the city’s school system, separating poor families of color from wealthy, white families who choose to send their children to private or suburban schools. Data from the U.S. Department of Education Civil Rights Data Collection suggests students are further segregated within the Syracuse City School District (SCSD) specifically within Advanced Placement classes. </p>
			<p>The Syracuse City School District (SCSD) is the city’s main public school system made up of nearly 40 different schools. According to data from the New York State Education Department (NYSED), The Syracuse City School District’s percent of Black students enrolled was nearly 50% in 2021. The district’s percent of white students enrolled in 2021 was nearly half of that at 22%. This data has not shifted since its first record of documentation in 2013.

			<h3>The Root of the Problem 
</h3>
			<p>The Civil Rights Act ended discrimination almost 50 years ago, still, this issue has remained prominent. One of the major trends seen in school segregation is the use of gerrymandering based on race and income. </p>
			<p>In Syracuse, the building of the I-81 highway effectively separated low-income families from high-income and wealthier families, promoting white-flight. It was built directly through a working-class black neighborhood, and displaced low-income families of color. The intent of the highway was to bring more opportunity to Syracuse’s downtown. Instead, the highway brought those opportunities, along with wealthier Syracuse residents out to the suburbs.</p>
			<p>“Syracuse is like many other cities in the northeast that have maintained segregation by housing, by ethnicity as we see the growth of suburbs that have become whiter and more distant from the city,” said George Theoharis, Professor of Educational Leadership at Syracuse University to <a href="https://cnycentral.com/news/the-map-segregated-syracuse/schools-across-syracuse-area-13th-most-segregated-by-race-in-the-nation/">CNY Central.</a>
			</p>
			<p>As a result, the Syracuse City School District–whose student body is made up of mostly black students, has been historically underfunded and underappreciated by the city and surrounding suburbs. Students within the SCSD have less access to opportunity and resources the suburban schools are able to offer.</p>
			<p>This division has continued to perpetuate the segregation of Syracuse schools.

			<h3>It Starts in the Classroom</h3>
			<p id="with-element">The building of I-81 segregated wealthy white families who moved to the suburbs from working-class and poverty level families of color who now make up the majority of the Syracuse City School District's enrollment. Recently SCSD students and families have noticed the AP classes are composed of mostly white students in contrast with the District’s majority black student body. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education Civil Rights showed that from 2009-2017, the percent of Black students enrolled in AP classes specifically at Nottingham, decreased by nearly 40%. </p>
			
			<p id="with-element">Emily Sommers, a 2017 graduate of Nottingham High School recalls her experience in AP classes. </p>
			<p id="with-element">“I kind of realized pretty quickly that the advanced classes were heavily skewed white,” she said, “Everyone wants to believe it’s so diverse and great but like, a lot of people talk the talk but don’t walk the walk.”</p>
			<p>What started out as a geographic issue condemned by the City of Syracuse, has turned into systemic segregation sustained by teachers and administration. </p>
			<p>“In general I think that Black students were simply not taken seriously as intellectuals unless they were exceptionally “well spoken” or behaved a certain way according to white standards of conduct.” Sommers said. “I think part of it is that the faculty is still so overwhelmingly white and unable or unwilling to recognize their own blind spots regarding race,” she said. </p>

			<h3>Going Forward </h3>
			<p>Syracuse has a long and sordid history resulting in a divided city, the segregation within the SCSD is just the tip of the iceberg of all the negative effects of the I-81 viaduct. Still, the education of Syracuse youth needs to become a priority among leaders and citizens alike. </p>
			<p>New York and U.S. Transportation officials planned to remove the part of the highway running through downtown Syracuse, and instead build a street-level grid to push traffic through earlier this year. Those efforts have been paused due to a restraining order implemented by the Renew 81 for All group. </p>

			</script>

			<p>Even if the reconstruction goes through, there are still efforts to be made regarding the future of the SCSD. Sommers hopes members of the SCSD are able to take accountability and right the wrongs of the past. </p>
			<p>“I hope Nottingham fosters better relationships with Black faculty who are able to recognize and meet the needs of the school’s students of color,” she says. “ I hope the white staff at Nottingham are able to come to terms with their blind spots and recognize that every student should be given the same attention and the same opportunity to unlock their full, learning potential.” </p>
